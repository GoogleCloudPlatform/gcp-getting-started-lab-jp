# Generate Phase: Billing-Only Migration Plan

> Loaded by generate.md when estimation-billing.json exists.

**Execute ALL steps in order. Do not skip or optimize.**

**Known limitations:** Partial IaC discovery (mixed Terraform/CloudFormation + billing-only services) is not yet supported. Confidence scoring per service based on billing SKU specificity is not yet implemented.

## Overview

This file produces a **conservative migration plan** with wider timelines and lower confidence thresholds than the infrastructure path. Billing-only data provides service-level spend but lacks configuration details (instance sizes, replication settings, networking topology). The plan accounts for this uncertainty with:

- Longer discovery refinement phase upfront
- Wider success criteria thresholds
- Explicit recommendation to run IaC discovery before executing the plan

## Prerequisites

Read the following artifacts from `$MIGRATION_DIR/`:

- `gcp-design-billing.json` (REQUIRED) -- Billing-based service mapping from Phase 3
- `estimation-billing.json` (REQUIRED) -- Billing-only cost estimates from Phase 4
- `billing-profile.json` (REQUIRED) -- AWS billing breakdown from Phase 1
- `preferences.json` (REQUIRED) -- User migration preferences from Phase 2

If any required file is missing: **STOP**. Output: "Missing required artifact: [filename]. Complete the prior phase that produces it."

## Part 1: Context and Limitations

### What Billing Data Provides

- Service-level monthly spend (which AWS services are in use)
- Relative cost distribution (which services are most expensive)
- AI signal detection (whether AI/ML services appear in billing)
- SKU-level hints about usage patterns

### What Billing Data Does NOT Provide

- Instance sizes and configurations (CPU, memory, storage)
- Networking topology (VPC, subnets, security groups)
- Database engines and versions
- Replication and high-availability settings
- Inter-service dependencies
- Scaling configurations (min/max instances, autoscaling policies)
- Security configurations (IAM roles, encryption settings)

### Recommendation

> **For a more accurate migration plan, provide Terraform files or CloudFormation templates and re-run discovery.**
> This billing-only plan is suitable for initial budgeting and stakeholder discussions,
> but must be refined with IaC discovery before executing the actual migration.

## Part 2: Conservative Timeline

A 15-week timeline with extended discovery and parallel-run phases to account for billing-only uncertainty.

### Stage 1: Discovery Refinement (Weeks 1-4)

- **Week 1-2**: Audit current AWS infrastructure manually
  - Document instance sizes, database configs, networking topology
  - Map dependencies between services
  - Identify stateful vs stateless services
  - Catalog secrets, environment variables, API keys
- **Week 3-4**: Refine GCP design based on discovered configurations
  - Update `gcp-design-billing.json` unknowns with actual values
  - Re-estimate costs with refined configuration data
  - Identify any services that need different GCP targets
  - Consider running IaC discovery if Terraform files or CloudFormation templates become available

### Stage 2: Service Migration (Weeks 5-9)

- **Week 5-6**: Provision GCP infrastructure
  - Set up VPC, subnets, firewall rules (based on discovery findings)
  - Provision compute, database, and storage resources
  - Configure IAM service accounts and roles
- **Week 7-8**: Deploy applications
  - Migrate application code and configurations
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines
  - Deploy to GCP staging environment
- **Week 9**: Integration testing
  - End-to-end testing on GCP
  - Performance baseline measurement
  - Data migration dry run

### Stage 3: Parallel Run (Weeks 10-12)

- Run both AWS and GCP simultaneously
- Compare performance, reliability, and costs
- Validate data consistency between environments
- Build confidence in GCP deployment
- Monitor for 2+ weeks before cutover decision

### Stage 4: Cutover and Validation (Weeks 13-15)

- **Week 13**: Execute cutover (DNS switch, traffic migration)
- **Week 14**: Intensive monitoring (48-hour watch period)
- **Week 15**: Stabilization and AWS teardown planning

## Part 3: Risk Assessment

Risks are higher for billing-only migrations due to configuration uncertainty.

| Risk                                                      | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Incorrect service sizing                                  | high        | high   | Extended discovery phase (Weeks 1-4); right-size after parallel run                                               |
| Missing dependencies discovered late                      | high        | medium | Manual dependency mapping in Week 1-2; extra buffer in timeline                                                   |
| Data migration complexity underestimated                  | medium      | high   | Dry run in Week 9; parallel run (Weeks 10-12) as safety net                                                       |
| Cost overrun due to unknown configurations                | high        | medium | Set billing alerts at 80% of high estimate; weekly cost reviews                                                   |
| Performance regression from incorrect sizing              | medium      | high   | Parallel run comparison; resize before cutover                                                                    |
| Longer timeline than planned                              | high        | medium | Build 3-week buffer into schedule; communicate 15-week plan upfront                                               |
| Unmapped services block migration                         | medium      | high   | Address unknowns in discovery refinement (Weeks 1-4)                                                              |
| Redshift migration complexity (if Redshift in billing)    | high        | high   | Engage GCP account team for specialist guidance on query patterns, data volumes, ETL pipelines, and BI integrations |

## Part 4: Per-Service Migration Steps

For each service in `gcp-design-billing.json.services[]`, generate a migration step template.

### Migration Step Template

```
Service: [aws_service] -> [gcp_service]
Monthly Cost: $[monthly_cost] (AWS) -> $[gcp_mid] estimated (GCP)
How chosen: Estimated from billing only (JSON: billing_inferred) -- see design-refs/fast-path.md User-facing vocabulary

Steps:
1. [ ] Determine actual configuration (instance size, storage, etc.)
   - TODO: Check AWS console or Terraform for [aws_service] configuration
2. [ ] Provision GCP [gcp_service] with discovered configuration
3. [ ] Migrate data (if applicable)
4. [ ] Test functionality and performance
5. [ ] Validate cost aligns with estimate

Unknowns:
- Instance sizing: TODO -- verify in AWS console
- Scaling configuration: TODO -- verify current autoscaling policies
- Dependencies: TODO -- map which services depend on this one
```

### Example: Fargate to Cloud Run

```
Service: Fargate -> Cloud Run
Monthly Cost: $450.00 (AWS) -> $270-$630 estimated (GCP)
How chosen: Estimated from billing only (JSON: billing_inferred)
SKU Hints: Fargate vCPU Hours, Fargate GB Memory Hours

Steps:
1. [ ] Determine actual configuration
   - TODO: Check CPU/memory allocation per Fargate task definition
   - TODO: Check desired count and scaling settings
   - TODO: Check number of ECS services
2. [ ] Create Cloud Run services with matching CPU/memory
3. [ ] Set up Cloud Load Balancing
4. [ ] Push container images to Artifact Registry
5. [ ] Configure autoscaling to match Fargate behavior
6. [ ] Test endpoint connectivity and performance

Unknowns:
- CPU allocation: TODO -- check Fargate task definitions
- Memory allocation: TODO -- check Fargate task definitions
- Number of services: TODO -- count from AWS console or aws CLI
- Concurrency settings: TODO -- check ECS service scaling policies
```

### Unmapped Services

For each entry in `gcp-design-billing.json.unknowns[]`:

```
Service: [aws_service] -- UNMAPPED
Monthly Cost: $[monthly_cost] (AWS)
Reason: [reason]
Suggestion: [suggestion]

Action Required:
- [ ] TODO: Manually identify the GCP equivalent for [aws_service]
- [ ] TODO: Determine configuration and sizing
- [ ] TODO: Add to migration plan once mapped
```

## Part 5: Success Criteria

Relaxed thresholds reflecting billing-only uncertainty.

| Criteria                    | Target                     | Note                                                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance within baseline | Within 20% of AWS          | Wider than infra path (10%) due to sizing uncertainty         |
| Monitoring stability        | 48-hour watch period       | Longer than infra path (24 hours)                             |
| Post-migration stability    | 45-day observation         | Longer than infra path (30 days)                              |
| Cost variance               | Within 40% of mid estimate | Wider than infra path (15%) due to billing-only confidence    |
| Data integrity              | 100%                       | Same as infra path -- no compromise on data                   |
| Service availability        | 99%                        | Lower than infra path (99.9%) initially, improve after tuning |

## Generate Phase Integration

The parent orchestrator (`generate.md`) uses `generation-billing.json` to:

1. Gate Stage 2 artifact generation -- `generate-artifacts-billing.md` requires this file
2. Provide billing context to `generate-artifacts-docs.md` for MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
3. Set phase completion status in `.phase-status.json`
