# GCP Hands on materials

**This is not an official Google product**.

The repository contains Google Colaboratory notebooks and scripts to learn how to use Google Cloud Platform. They are supposed to be used at GCP hands-on trainings for Japanese speakers, and some contents are written in Japanese. You can find instructions either in README or notebooks themselves.
